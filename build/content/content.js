    HOW TO DO THIS: 
        INVERT APPROACH: 
            CALL INVERT(1) HUE-ROTATE(180DEG) TO INVERT ALL OF THE COLORS ON THE PAGE

            PROS: 
                VERY EASY APPROACH
            CONS: 
                SOME ELEMENTS CANNOT BE SEEN THAT WELL BECAUSE THEY ARE SO DARK

        MIXED APPROACH: 
            INVERT W/ CSS
            BRIGHTEN COLORS WITH DARK BACKGROUND COLOR TO INCREASE CONTRAST
*/

/*
    MIXED APPROACH IN DEPTH:    
        ADD .DARK-MODE TO <HTML>
        ADD .DARK-MODE TO IMAGES AND VIDEOS IN THE PAGE TO REVERT THEM BACK TO NORMAL
        FOR EVERY ELEMENT IN THE PAGE, 
            IF THE BACKGROUND COLOR IS WHITE, 
                DARKEN THE WHITE A LITTLE BIT
                (CONVERTED, THIS WILL MAKE THE BLACK MORE READABLE)
